<p>The Program was developed in conjunction with an Advisory Board consisting of both UW faculty and industry professionals:</p>

<td>T-Mobile</td>
<td>And others...</td>
</tr>


</table>

The goal of the Certificate Program is to provide industry professionals with the core development skills needed to develop an application on the Android platform. In the first two courses, we will cover both beginning and advanced topics. The Program concludes with a course in app publication and mobile app marketing. Students will work on a variety of devices (handsets, tablets and <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TVs</a>) generously donated by several Board member companies including Google.
